This project will mostly be a running log of films and novels I have seen and liked, a sort of art journal to both curate and cultivate inspiration - and make sure I am taking in as much as I am making things myself. 

Each entry will be treated as impressions which could grow into an experimental essays-in-progress, ordered under the heading of the filmmaker(s), author(s) or theme(s) rather than the chronological date of post. 

I am thinking of its possible layout as a customization of things I liked about posting on the social media platforms I no longer have or want, but still sort of miss...for the records they kept, and act of sharing online at all, mostly.
